-[***NOTICE:***]

- I am a *system*, but please treat me as a singlet as I'm *uncomfortable* discussing about my disorder(s). This is just here to remind you to be patient with me if I don't remember certain details or other such things. This is something I cannot control so I advise you to be respectful.
- I use acronyms/abbreviations very often, feel free to ask what they mean. I don't like typing a lot.
- Interaction such as **booping, sitting next to me, etc**. are alright just as long as you aren't weird about it. 🌟
- I'm not a very active person, sorrgy... But you can totes check my twitter : )
- I'm a Ryoshu/Yoshihide fictkin haha can you tell haha.ha. whatever.
